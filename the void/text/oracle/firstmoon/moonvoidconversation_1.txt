0 : Hello, <CapPlayerName>. : 60
0 : What are you? Your appearance seems... unusual, although familiar. : 90
0 : I see you have the mark of communication. Did Five Pebbles give it to you, or maybe someone else did, from some faraway land? : 90
0 : In any case, it looks like you are capable of long-distance travel. Did you see my friend on the way here, by any chance? He looks just like you, but I am not sure... : 120
0 : He left me not so long ago, and... it can be very lonely here, although sometimes I hear someone scavenging in the distance. : 90
0 : But it looks like now I have you to keep me company. If you want to stay here for a while, of course. : 90
0 : By the way, if you find anything noteworthy, you can bring it to me. I might tell you something interesting about it. That is all I can do for now. : 60
