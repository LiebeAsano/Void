0 : Oh, it is you. : 60
0 : How are you, <CapPlayerName>? I hope you are doing well. : 120
0 : Hmm, you look hungry. Or is it just me? : 60
0 : I am so sorry, but I do not have anything here to feed you. I really wish I could offer you something but... In my condition this is no longer possible. : 120
0 : But that is not the point. There's not much time left. I wish you a successful hunt, <CapPlayerName>. I would hate it if my only companion were to starve to death. : 60
0 : Come back when you feel better, maybe next cycle. In the meantime I will try to remember something interesting to tell you. : 120
