I would be interested in exploring your body, but my state don't let me do something like this...
The fact that you came back to me again suggests that you're lost.
You might be looking for a friend of mine. Her name is Looks to the Moon, her state much worse then mine.
She's a short distance to the east of here. If the little beast has accomplished his mission,<LINE> perhaps she can help you find what you've been looking for.
