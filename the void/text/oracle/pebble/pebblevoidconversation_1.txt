0 : ...is this reaching you? : 60
0 : What a disgusting and horrible structure you have. I was unsure if implanting the mark would kill you. : 60
0 : But you are still alive, so your brain is intact. Or, at least partially intact... : 60
0 : You may have come to me for help, but my medical equipment has been out of order for a long time. For that reason, there is no point in killing you to study your body. : 60
0 : . . . : 120

0 : Based on the data available, I assume you interacted with the void fluid in some way. Surprisingly, you were able to reach me. : 60

0 : Supposedly, you have less than a cycle to live, so make the most of the time you have left. In the meantime, leave me alone. : 60
