0 : ...is it reaching you? : 60
0 : What a disgusting and horrible structure you have. I wasn't sure if implanting the mark would have killed you. : 60
0 : But you are still alive, so your brain is intact. Or at least partially intact... : 60
0 : You may have come to me for help, but my medical equipment has been out of order for a long time. For the same reason there is no point in killing you to study your body. : 60
0 : . . . : 120

0 : Based on the data available I assume you interacted with the Void Fluid in some way. I am surprised you were able to get to me. : 60

0 : Supposedly you have less than a cycle to live, so make the most of the time you have left. In the meantime, leave me alone. : 60
