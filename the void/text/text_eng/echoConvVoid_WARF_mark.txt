What brings you to me, pet? 
You do not often see a rodent marked with an iterator. Did you deliberately seek out a meeting with me?
I was lost once. When I was one of the last to leave, this was not the fate I expected.
I was scared. Maybe that is why I cannot move on right now. 
Don't let fear bind you like it did to me.
