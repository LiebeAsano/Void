What brings you to me, little beast? I have never felt such a strange harmony.
Were you looking for a meeting intentionally or were you just lost?
I was lost once. When I was one of the last to leave, this was not the fate I expected.
I was scared. Maybe that is why I cannot move on right now. 
Why does your presence cause me the same fear?
