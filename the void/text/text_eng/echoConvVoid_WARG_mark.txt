There are so many snowflakes here! One, ten, one hundred, one thousand, one million!
But it was not always like this, once the sun dried me up inside and out.
Even though I no longer feel hot or cold, I am still struck by beauty to the depths of my soul.
I want to see this landscape forever! But the world is changeable, unlike me.
I hope you will come back someday and we will enjoy the view one last time.
