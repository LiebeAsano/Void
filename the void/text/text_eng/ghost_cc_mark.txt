Behold this empty husk of a land.
And here in front of me is a creature that, as if from ancient legends, stepped through the clouds of storm and destruction.
Your existence stirs my memory, awakening echoes of former greatness and hopes.
In this harsh world, where every step can be your last, you persist.
Perhaps there is the melody of a new era in you, a whisper of future days that will not fade in the shadow of the past.
May your journey continue, wanderer, for even among the ruins you can find new traces of life.
