Look at you, sacrificing everyone only prolongs your suffering.....
But I am envious that such a small beast has such a thirst for life.
Your existence stirs the strings of my soul, awakening a primal animal fear.
It's amazing that this harsh world continues to produce more and more greedy creatures.
Perhaps your hunger will lead you to your goal, but be prepared to be consumed by your own shadow.
Let your journey continue, beast, for not even the sea can dissolve such an immense ego.
