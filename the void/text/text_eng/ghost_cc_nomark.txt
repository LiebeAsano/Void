Look at yourself. An empty shell that only prolongs your suffering.
Envy arises in me that someone like you has such a thirst for life.
Your existence awakens a primal fear from within me.
It is amazing that such a harsh world continues to produce greedier and greedier creatures.
Your nature goes against everything we have ever created. Following my path will ruin you.
Perhaps your hunger will lead you to your goal, but be prepared to be consumed by your own shadow.
Let your journey continue, for even the Sea cannot dissolve such an immense ego.
