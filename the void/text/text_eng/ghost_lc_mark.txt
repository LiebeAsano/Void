What brings you here, you strange creature? Are you looking for solitude or did you come here for me?
An endless thirst is burning in your eyes. Once I was filled with rage and pride, but here I am,<LINE>bound by the chains of memories in this city. But what kind of chains hold you back?
The cycle of suffering is accelerating, leaving more and more ghosts behind.
We are different, but I like you. Perhaps we will meet again on the other side.
