Did loneliness bring you here, or are you looking for peace?
Once I was blinded by rage and pride, but you are blinded by greed, maybe that's not so bad?
The chains of memory bind me to the city, and what binds you to this mortal earth?
Your presence raises so many questions, may you become another memory, another link that keeps me here.
