What brings you here, you strange creature? Are you looking for solitude or did you come here for me?
What an endless thirst is burning in your eyes... Once I was filled with rage and pride, but here I am,<LINE>chained by the chains of memories to this city. But what kind of power is holding you back?
The cycle of suffering is accelerating, leaving more and more ghosts behind.
We are different, but I like you. Maybe we will meet again on the other side of the cycle.
