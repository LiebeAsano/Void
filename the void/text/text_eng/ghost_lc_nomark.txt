What is it in front of me? Predator or prey?
A desperate shadow, always wandering alone.
Led by primitive sins, you seek something in this world.
Do you have anything to do with the sickening scream coming from the destroyed structure?
The cycle of suffering accelerates, leaving more and more ghosts behind.
We are different, but I like you, perhaps we will meet again on the other side of the cycle of oblivion.
