What lies in front of me? Predator or prey?
A desperate shadow, always wandering alone.
Led by primitive sins, you seek something in this world.
Do you have anything to do with the sickening screams echoing from the destroyed superstructure?
From up here, I see a ghost, hovering above the ruins... It calls for you.
Find your way by following the deep instinct that has leaded you so far.
I will stay here, and the memory of you will become another of my chains.
