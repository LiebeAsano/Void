A strange feeling does not leave me... Sometimes it feels like everything is going back to normal.
Even after all these years. I would never have thought that I would come across a live rodent that came out of the void sea...
The weather has changed, but the fields... They are still gently swaying under the gusts of wind, as before.
Your extraordinary feat makes me think.
A boundless universal void opened up before me...
But here I am, and you are standing in front of me, breaking all the dogmas that we have been building for centuries.
What made you come back?
