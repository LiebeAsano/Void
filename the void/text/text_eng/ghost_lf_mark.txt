A strange feeling does not leave me... Sometimes it feels as if everything is returning to normal.
I would never have thought that I would come across a live rodent that came from the Void Sea...
The weather has changed, but the fields... They are still gently swaying under the gusts of the wind, as before.
Your extraordinary feat makes me think.
A boundless universal void opened up before me...
But here I am, and you are standing in front of me, breaking all the dogmas that we have been building for centuries.
Why did you return?
