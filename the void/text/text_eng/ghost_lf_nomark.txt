A strange feeling comes over me... It's as if something is digging into me...
I never thought I'd meet someone who clings so desperately to a cycle.
The weather has changed and life continues to change and overcome all obstacles.
Your extraordinary feat... no... your thirst makes me think.
I believed my path was the only true solution in this boundless universal void.
But now you stand before me, defying every law we've so carefully constructed.
Why are you so drawn to this mortal world when reality itself prevents your existence?
