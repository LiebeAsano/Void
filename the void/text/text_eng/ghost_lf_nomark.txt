A strange feeling comes over me... It's as if something is digging into me.
I never thought I'd see a rodent clinging so desperately to a bicycle.
The weather has changed, but life... Still changing, adapting, overcoming every obstacle.
Your extraordinary achievement... no, your thirst makes me think.
I believed my path was the only true solution in this boundless universal void.
But now you stand before me, defying every law we've so carefully constructed.
Why are you so drawn to this mortal world when reality itself prevents your existence?
