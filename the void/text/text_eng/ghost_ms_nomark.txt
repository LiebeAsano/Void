You got to me after all. Your mind is much clearer and your vessel much stronger.
Do you realise that the sea is indifferent to us? We couldn't accept it and it rejected us.
These endless cycles, like torture, drive me mad, cloud my judgement.
But unlike me, you stand here before me, trapped in your own prison.
A newborn soul entwined with yours, sharing the same fate as you, for now...
Dissolution no longer threatens you, now you are doomed, having deprived yourself of the last solution.
It is a pity that we have reached the space, reached all the depths, but could not see the emptiness within ourselves.
