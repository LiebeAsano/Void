Have you really returned from the Void Sea?
The depths, a place where others have only found the end, has become the beginning for you.
This event, which never could have been predicted, violates everything we thought we knew.
What fools... We did not dig deep enough, blinded by pride and a sense of superiority, disappearing into the void, like many before us.
One day, a new civilization will discover our remains. Will they repeat the same mistake?
