A little beast... Have you really returned from the Void Sea?
The depths, a place where others have only found the end, have become the beginning for you.
This event, which no one could have predicted, violates everything we have known so far.
What fools... We did not dig deep enough, blinded by pride and a sense of superiority, and disappeared into the void, like many before us.
One day, a new civilization will make its way through our remains.
