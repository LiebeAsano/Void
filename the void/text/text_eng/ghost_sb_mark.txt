Little beast... Have you returned from the void sea? 
It's an event no one could have predicted and it violates everything we've known so far.
The depths, a place where others have found only an end - have become a beginning for you. 
Perhaps these ancient tunnels and caves, past achievements and failures, mean something different to you.
Your journey has changed the essence of our understandings. Rethinking, overcoming the unimaginable, all of it is now to be rethought.
You are not our saviour, but your return is a mystery. A mystery that challenges our understanding and raises new questions. 
How much more do we not know? How far beyond our usual boundaries can we go?
Let it remain a reminder that in a complex world, replete with the remains of past civilisations, there is always room for the unexpected and the unexplainable.
