Do you hear that cry? A voice that comes from the space itself.
The fluctuations, which are like waves, are so far away, but I can feel them clearly.
Even the Depths, which are the place of the end, have become the place of birth for you.
Take care of your vessel and don't let anyone defile it. Your path will change the nature of our understanding.
It will take hundreds of thousands of cycles before anyone gets another chance.
You are a reminder that we have not gone too far beyond our usual boundaries.
Follow the call to the east, to the remnants of a bygone civilization.
