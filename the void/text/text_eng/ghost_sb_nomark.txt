Do you hear that cry? A voice that comes from the air itself.
The fluctuations, which are like ripples and waves, are so far away, but I can feel them clearly.
Even the depths, which usually spells the end, has become a place of rebirth for you.
Take care of your vessel and do not let it be defiled. Your path will change the nature of understanding.
It will take hundreds of thousands of cycles before another opportunity to repeat your predicament emerges.
You are a reminder that we knew nothing about our world, that all of our models were flawed.
Follow the call to the east, to the remnants of a bygone civilization.
