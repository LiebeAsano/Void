You have no name, and your existence is only symbolic.
But my life made sense! And now I'm just going through the same nightmare.
After giving up your own happiness, you went deep into the heart of void and yet returned.
Do they know that, without a name, you have created a new legend?
Should I keep digging into my memories or should I be inspired by your courage and search?
Should I envy your prison of flesh, when you yourself have gone beyond its limits, proving that even the unbelievable is possible?
