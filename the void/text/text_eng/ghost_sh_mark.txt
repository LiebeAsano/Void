You have no name, and your existence is only symbolic.
But there was meaning in my life! Right now, I am just a prisoner reminiscing.
Having given up on your own happiness, you went deep into the very heart of emptiness and came back anyway.
Do they know that you, without having a name, have created a new legend?
Should I continue to rummage in my memory or be inspired by your courage and search?
Should I envy your prison of flesh, when you yourself pushed its boundaries and proved that even the incredible is possible?
