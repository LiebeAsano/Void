You have no name. Your existence is only symbolic.
I had a name. But now, I am stuck as a prisoner reminiscing.
You forfeited your own happiness, you went deep into the very heart of emptiness and came back anyways.
Do they know that you, a nameless beast, have created a new legend?
Should I continue to linger on my past or be inspired by your courage and search a new?
Should I envy your prison of flesh, who pushed its boundaries and proved that even the incredible is possible?
