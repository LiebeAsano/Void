You have no name, but your existence is only symbolic.
You represent mystery and secret.
So proud. There was jubilation! My name was sung, loud and clear.
Did they know? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay?
Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?
Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?
You gave up your own happiness, you went deep into the heart of the void, and still you returned.
Do they know that you, without a name, have given birth to a new legend?
Should I continue to rummage through my memories or be inspired by your courage and quest?
Should I envy your prison of flesh when you have pushed its boundaries and proved that even the unbelievable is possible?
