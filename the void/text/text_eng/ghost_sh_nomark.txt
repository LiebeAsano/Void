You have no name, yet your existence shakes the very essence of the universe.
Even here, without a body, I feel an indescribable presence in the raindrops.
Nameless one, are you ready to give up your own happiness or would you prefer to sacrifice someone else's?
Should you continue to delve into your past, or do you aim for the future without hesitation?
Keep your prison of flesh. No one should interfere with the nature of the Void Sea.
