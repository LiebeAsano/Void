The echo... without a name, that existence oscillates cycles.
Towering over the achievements of his civilisation, wait for something, watch.
Even here, without a body, I feel an indescribable irritation in the raindrops.
Nameless, are you willing to give up your own happiness or would you rather sacrifice someone else's?
Should you continue to dwell on the past, or should you look to the future without hesitation?
Keep your prison of flesh. No one should interfere with the nature of the Void Sea.
