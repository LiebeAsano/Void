You hear that, baby? The buzzing in the air?
The endless chatter of a thousand thousand voices of the long dead?
You understand them, having gone through what no one dared even imagine.
The one who came back from the void sea alive... You broke the laws of the universe, broke an old, established idea. 
Something interesting, isn't it? Now your will and your essence will intersect with something that was conceived long ago.
You have opened new paths, my thousands of voices now sound in unison with yours. Now the question is, what will you do next, little one?
