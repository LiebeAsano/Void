Do you hear that? The voice that comes out of the hum in the air?
An incredible ego that interrupts the endless chatter of thousands of thousands of voices long dead?
You do not need a gift to hear their regret and sorrow.
The one who returned from the Void Sea... You have nothing but hunger, your thirst for life is comparable to stupidity.
It is funny, is not it? Your will intersects with your essence.
An unprecedented path is available to you. This voice now sounds in unison with yours.
