Do you hear it? The voice rising above the hum of the air?
The incredible ego that interrupts the endless chatter of a thousand voices of the long dead?
You understand their thoughts, there is much regret and sorrow in them, but no one is able to speak them.
It who has returned from the void sea... You have nothing in you but hunger, and your selfishness is like foolish.
Interesting, isn't it? Your will intersects with your essence.
There is an invisible path available to you, and this voice is now in harmony with yours.
