Do you hear that? The voice that emerges from the hum of the air?
An incredible ego that interrupts the endless chatter of countless millions of voices long dead?
You do not need a gift to hear their regret and sorrow.
The one who returned from the Void Sea... You have nothing but hunger and your foolish will to survive.
It is funny, isn't it? Your will intersects with your essence.
An unprecedented path is available to you. This voice now sounds in unison with yours.
