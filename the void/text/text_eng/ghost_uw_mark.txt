We feel your presence, little creature.
Your attunement... it became different.
Your existence breaks the cycles. Our assumptions turned out to be incorrect.
What force or fate brought you back?
Suffering, cycles... We probably missed something important.
Perhaps even the ancients did not fully comprehend the truth of the universe.
Your path is a new mystery, a new hope.
We will be watching.
