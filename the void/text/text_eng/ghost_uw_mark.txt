We can feel your presence, little creature.
Your attunement... it became another... 
And your existence disrupts the cycles, our assumptions turned out to be incorrect.
What force or fate brought you back?
The struggle, the cycles have become different, and our understanding of these phenomena has changed.
Perhaps even the ancients did not all grasp the truth of the universe.
We may have missed something important.
Your path is a new mystery, a new hope.
We will watch.
