We feel your presence, little creature.
Your attunement... it has changed.
Your existence breaks the cycles. Our assumptions turned out to be incorrect.
What force or fate brought you back?
The suffering, the cycles... We failed to notice something very important.
Perhaps even the ancients did not fully comprehend the truth of the universe.
Your path is a new mystery, a new hope.
We will be watching.
