Little beast... your presence is deeper than ever.
Your consonance resonates with our souls. You cannot hear our cyclical voices, but you understand our thoughts.
The mark is truly a marvellous gift, but for you it will turn into a curse.
In words we all crave knowledge, but in our thoughts we only suffer in endless cycles.
But your nature is different - long since beyond our comprehension.
Keep following your instincts, they will help you find the answers to your questions.
