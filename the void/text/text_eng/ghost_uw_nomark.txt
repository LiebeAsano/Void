Your presence is deeper than ever.
Your consonance resonates with our souls. You cannot hear our cyclical voices, but you understand our thoughts.
The mark is truly a marvellous gift, but for you it will turn into a curse.
Your nature is different - it has long been beyond our understanding.
Continue to follow your instincts, they will help you find answers to your questions.
We will no longer reach new heights, we will only continue to watch the decline of our civilisation.
