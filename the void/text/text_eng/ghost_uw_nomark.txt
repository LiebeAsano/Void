Your presence is deeper than ever.
Your harmony resonates with our souls. You do not hear our cyclical voices, but you understand our thoughts.
The mark is truly a wonderful gift, but it will turn into a curse for you.
Your nature is different – it has long been beyond our comprehension.
Follow its call before your hunger consumes you completely.
We will no longer reach new heights, we will only continue to observe the decline of our civilization.
