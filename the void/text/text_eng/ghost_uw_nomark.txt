Your presence is deeper than ever.
Your harmony resonates with our very being. You do not hear our cyclical voices, but you understand our thoughts.

Your nature is different – it is almost beyond comprehension.
Follow its call before your hunger consumes you completely.
We will no longer reach new heights, we will only continue to observe the decline of our civilization.
